# image-steganography-using-3-way-encryption
The project is based on image steganography which uses 3 ways of encryption in hiding the data for adding extra security which involves the use of algorithm like AES, DES AND LSB .In this system, we have used  AES, DES, and LSB techniques to encrypt a secret message and then hide it within an image using the LSB steganography technique. This system increases the workload for attackers by forcing them to first acquire image sets for each user, and then conduct hotspot analysis on each of these images.
